RESUME

A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model of data.
In a relational database, data is organized into tables, and each table contains a set of rows and columns.
The rows represent individual records, and the columns represent the different data fields within those records.

A RDBMS allows you to create, modify, and query these tables using SQL (Structured Query Language).
SQL is a programming language that is specifically designed for working with relational database. 
It allows you to perform a wide range of operations, including creating and modifying tables, inserting and updating data, and querying the data in the database.

Some examples of popular RDBMS software include MySQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server. 
These systems are used by organizations of all sizes to store and manage their data, and they are an essential part of many business applications and websites.

In addition to their ability to store and manipulate data, RDBMS also offer a number of other benefits, such as data integrity, security, and reliability. 
They also support features like transactions and concurrency control, which allow multiple users to access and update the data in the database without interfering with each other.

Overall, RDBMS are powerful tools for managing and organizing data, and they are an important part of many modern computing systems.
