# Introduction-SQL
[365 Data Science](https://learn.365datascience.com/) gave me the opportunity for free learning, and in this state, I decided to take course in SQL to improve my skills and be better.

## ðŸ‘€ Also, I learned:
1. Study the components of SQL.
2. Store, retrieve, and manipulate data from relational databases.
3. Know how to set up a connection between Workbench and the server.
4. Create databases and work with them.
5. Apply the best SQL practices.
6. Understand relational databases management systems.
